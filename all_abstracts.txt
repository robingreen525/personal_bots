The dynamics of adaptation determine which mutations fix in a population, and
hence how reproducible evolution will be. This is central to understanding the
spectra of mutations recovered in the evolution of antibiotic resistance, the
response of pathogens to immune selection, and the dynamics of cancer
progression. In laboratory evolution experiments, demonstrably beneficial
mutations are found repeatedly, but are often accompanied by other mutations with
no obvious benefit. Here we use whole-genome whole-population sequencing to
examine the dynamics of genome sequence evolution at high temporal resolution in 
40 replicate Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations growing in rich medium for
1,000 generations. We find pervasive genetic hitchhiking: multiple mutations
arise and move synchronously through the population as mutational 'cohorts'.
Multiple clonal cohorts are often present simultaneously, competing with each
other in the same population. Our results show that patterns of sequence
evolution are driven by a balance between these chance effects of hitchhiking and
interference, which increase stochastic variation in evolutionary outcomes, and
the deterministic action of selection on individual mutations, which favours
parallel evolutionary solutions in replicate populations.

Identifying the mechanisms that create and maintain biodiversity is a central
challenge in biology. Stable diversification of microbial populations often
requires the evolution of differences in resource utilization. Alternatively,
coexistence can be maintained by specialization to exploit spatial heterogeneity 
in the environment. Here, we report spontaneous diversification maintained by a
related but distinct mechanism: crowding avoidance. During experimental evolution
of laboratory Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, we observed the repeated
appearance of "adherent" (A) lineages able to grow as a dispersed film, in
contrast to their crowded "bottom-dweller" (B) ancestors. These two types stably 
coexist because dispersal reduces interference competition for nutrients among
kin, at the cost of a slower maximum growth rate. This tradeoff causes the
frequencies of the two types to oscillate around equilibrium over the course of
repeated cycles of growth, crowding, and dispersal. However, further coevolution 
of the A and B types can perturb and eventually destroy their coexistence over
longer time scales. We introduce a simple mathematical model of this "semistable"
coexistence, which explains the interplay between ecological and evolutionary
dynamics. Because crowded growth generally limits nutrient access in biofilms,
the mechanism we report here may be broadly important in maintaining diversity in
these natural environments.

The fitness landscape is a powerful metaphor for describing the relationship
between genotype and phenotype for a population under selection. However,
empirical data as to the topography of fitness landscapes are limited, owing to
difficulties in measuring fitness for large numbers of genotypes under any
condition. We previously reported a case of reciprocal sign epistasis (RSE),
where two mutations individually increased yeast fitness in a glucose-limited
environment, but reduced fitness when combined, suggesting the existence of two
peaks on the fitness landscape. We sought to determine whether a ridge connected 
these peaks so that populations founded by one mutant could reach the peak
created by the other, avoiding the low-fitness "Valley-of-Death" between them.
Sequencing clones after 250 generations of further evolution provided no evidence
for such a ridge, but did reveal many presumptive beneficial mutations, adding to
a growing body of evidence that clonal interference pervades evolving microbial
populations.

Centromeres are essential for proper chromosome segregation. Despite extensive
research, centromere locations in yeast genomes remain difficult to infer, and in
most species they are still unknown. Recently, the chromatin conformation capture
assay, Hi-C, has been re-purposed for diverse applications, including de novo
genome assembly, deconvolution of metagenomic samples and inference of centromere
locations. We describe a method, Centurion, that jointly infers the locations of 
all centromeres in a single genome from Hi-C data by exploiting the centromeres' 
tendency to cluster in three-dimensional space. We first demonstrate the accuracy
of Centurion in identifying known centromere locations from high coverage Hi-C
data of budding yeast and a human malaria parasite. We then use Centurion to
infer centromere locations in 14 yeast species. Across all microbes that we
consider, Centurion predicts 89% of centromeres within 5 kb of their known
locations. We also demonstrate the robustness of the approach in datasets with
low sequencing depth. Finally, we predict centromere coordinates for six yeast
species that currently lack centromere annotations. These results show that
Centurion can be used for centromere identification for diverse species of yeast 
and possibly other microorganisms.

A primary goal of recent work in experimental evolution is to probe the molecular
basis of adaptation. This requires an understanding of the individual mutations
in evolving populations: their identity, their physiological and fitness effects,
and the interactions between them. The combination of high-throughput methods for
laboratory evolution and next-generation sequencing methods now makes it possible
to identify and quantify mutations in hundreds of replicate populations over
thousands of generations, and to directly measure fitness effects and epistatic
interactions. Many laboratories are now leveraging these tools to study the
molecular basis of adaptation and the reproducibility of evolutionary outcomes
across a variety of model systems. Genetic analyses on evolved populations are
shedding light on the statistics of epistasis between evolved mutations. Here we 
review the current understanding of the spectrum of mutations observed across
these systems, with a focus on epistatic interactions between beneficial
mutations and constraints on evolutionary outcomes. We emphasize evolution in
asexual microbes, where next generation sequencing methods have been widely
applied.

Evolution of large asexual cell populations underlies ∼30% of deaths worldwide,
including those caused by bacteria, fungi, parasites, and cancer. However, the
dynamics underlying these evolutionary processes remain poorly understood because
they involve many competing beneficial lineages, most of which never rise above
extremely low frequencies in the population. To observe these normally hidden
evolutionary dynamics, we constructed a sequencing-based ultra high-resolution
lineage tracking system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allowed us to monitor
the relative frequencies of ∼500,000 lineages simultaneously. In contrast to some
expectations, we found that the spectrum of fitness effects of beneficial
mutations is neither exponential nor monotonic. Early adaptation is a predictable
consequence of this spectrum and is strikingly reproducible, but the initial
small-effect mutations are soon outcompeted by rarer large-effect mutations that 
result in variability between replicates. These results suggest that early
evolutionary dynamics may be deterministic for a period of time before stochastic
effects become important.

Spontaneous mutations are ultimately essential for evolutionary change and are
also the root cause of many diseases. However, until recently, both biological
and technical barriers have prevented detailed analyses of mutation profiles,
constraining our understanding of the mutation process to a few model organisms
and leaving major gaps in our understanding of the role of genome content and
structure on mutation. Here, we present a genome-wide view of the molecular
mutation spectrum in Burkholderia cenocepacia, a clinically relevant pathogen
with high %GC content and multiple chromosomes. We find that B. cenocepacia has
low genome-wide mutation rates with insertion-deletion mutations biased toward
deletions, consistent with the idea that deletion pressure reduces prokaryotic
genome sizes. Unlike prior studies of other organisms, mutations in B.
cenocepacia are not AT biased, which suggests that at least some genomes with
high %GC content experience unusual base-substitution mutation pressure.
Importantly, we also observe variation in both the rates and spectra of mutations
among chromosomes and elevated G:C > T:A transversions in late-replicating
regions. Thus, although some patterns of mutation appear to be highly conserved
across cellular life, others vary between species and even between chromosomes of
the same species, potentially influencing the evolution of nucleotide composition
and genome architecture.

A major goal of genetics is to define the relationship between phenotype and
genotype, while a major goal of ecology is to identify the rules that govern
community assembly. Achieving these goals by analyzing natural systems can be
difficult, as selective pressures create dynamic fitness landscapes that vary in 
both space and time. Laboratory experimental evolution offers the benefit of
controlling variables that shape fitness landscapes, helping to achieve both
goals. We previously showed that a clonal population of E. coli experimentally
evolved under continuous glucose limitation gives rise to a genetically diverse
community consisting of one clone, CV103, that best scavenges but incompletely
utilizes the limiting resource, and others, CV101 and CV116, that consume its
overflow metabolites. Because this community can be disassembled and reassembled,
and involves cooperative interactions that are stable over time, its genetic
diversity is sustained by clonal reinforcement rather than by clonal
interference. To understand the genetic factors that produce this outcome, and to
illuminate the community's underlying physiology, we sequenced the genomes of
ancestral and evolved clones. We identified ancestral mutations in intermediary
metabolism that may have predisposed the evolution of metabolic interdependence. 
Phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that the lineages that gave rise to this
community diverged early, as CV103 shares only one Single Nucleotide Polymorphism
with the other evolved clones. Underlying CV103's phenotype we identified a set
of mutations that likely enhance glucose scavenging and maintain redox balance,
but may do so at the expense of carbon excreted in overflow metabolites. Because 
these overflow metabolites serve as growth substrates that are differentially
accessible to the other community members, and because the scavenging lineage
shares only one SNP with these other clones, we conclude that this lineage likely
served as an "engine" generating diversity by creating new metabolic niches, but 
not the occupants themselves.

Microbial communities consist of mixed populations of organisms, including
unknown species in unknown abundances. These communities are often studied
through metagenomic shotgun sequencing, but standard library construction methods
remove long-range contiguity information; thus, shotgun sequencing and de novo
assembly of a metagenome typically yield a collection of contigs that cannot
readily be grouped by species. Methods for generating chromatin-level contact
probability maps, e.g., as generated by the Hi-C method, provide a signal of
contiguity that is completely intracellular and contains both intrachromosomal
and interchromosomal information. Here, we demonstrate how this signal can be
exploited to reconstruct the individual genomes of microbial species present
within a mixed sample. We apply this approach to two synthetic metagenome
samples, successfully clustering the genome content of fungal, bacterial, and
archaeal species with more than 99% agreement with published reference genomes.
We also show that the Hi-C signal can secondarily be used to create scaffolded
genome assemblies of individual eukaryotic species present within the microbial
community, with higher levels of contiguity than some of the species' published
reference genomes.

The fate of a newly arising beneficial mutation depends on many factors, such as 
the population size and the availability and fitness effects of other mutations
that accumulate in the population. It has proved difficult to understand how
these factors influence the trajectories of particular mutations, since
experiments have primarily focused on characterizing successful clones emerging
from a small number of evolving populations. Here, we present the results of a
massively parallel experiment designed to measure the full spectrum of possible
fates of new beneficial mutations in hundreds of experimental yeast populations, 
whether these mutations are ultimately successful or not. Using strains in which 
a particular class of beneficial mutation is detectable by fluorescence, we
followed the trajectories of these beneficial mutations across 592 independent
populations for 1000 generations. We find that the fitness advantage provided by 
individual mutations plays a surprisingly small role. Rather, underlying
"background" genetic variation is quickly generated in our initially clonal
populations and plays a crucial role in determining the fate of each individual
beneficial mutation in the evolving population.

Genome rearrangements are associated with eukaryotic evolutionary processes
ranging from tumorigenesis to speciation. Rearrangements are especially common
following interspecific hybridization, and some of these could be expected to
have strong selective value. To test this expectation we created de novo
interspecific yeast hybrids between two diverged but largely syntenic
Saccharomyces species, S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum, then experimentally evolved
them under continuous ammonium limitation. We discovered that a characteristic
interspecific genome rearrangement arose multiple times in independently evolved 
populations. We uncovered nine different breakpoints, all occurring in a narrow
~1-kb region of chromosome 14, and all producing an "interspecific fusion
junction" within the MEP2 gene coding sequence, such that the 5' portion derives 
from S. cerevisiae and the 3' portion derives from S. uvarum. In most cases the
rearrangements altered both chromosomes, resulting in what can be considered to
be an introgression of a several-kb region of S. uvarum into an otherwise intact 
S. cerevisiae chromosome 14, while the homeologous S. uvarum chromosome 14
experienced an interspecific reciprocal translocation at the same breakpoint
within MEP2, yielding a chimaeric chromosome; these events result in the presence
in the cell of two MEP2 fusion genes having identical breakpoints. Given that
MEP2 encodes for a high-affinity ammonium permease, that MEP2 fusion genes arise 
repeatedly under ammonium-limitation, and that three independent evolved isolates
carrying MEP2 fusion genes are each more fit than their common ancestor, the
novel MEP2 fusion genes are very likely adaptive under ammonium limitation. Our
results suggest that, when homoploid hybrids form, the admixture of two genomes
enables swift and otherwise unavailable evolutionary innovations. Furthermore,
the architecture of the MEP2 rearrangement suggests a model for rapid
introgression, a phenomenon seen in numerous eukaryotic phyla, that does not
require repeated backcrossing to one of the parental species.

Whole-genome sequencing, particularly in fungi, has progressed at a tremendous
rate. More difficult, however, is experimental testing of the inferences about
gene function that can be drawn from comparative sequence analysis alone. We
present a genome-wide functional characterization of a sequenced but
experimentally understudied budding yeast, Saccharomyces bayanus var. uvarum
(henceforth referred to as S. bayanus), allowing us to map changes over the 20
million years that separate this organism from S. cerevisiae. We first created a 
suite of genetic tools to facilitate work in S. bayanus. Next, we measured the
gene-expression response of S. bayanus to a diverse set of perturbations
optimized using a computational approach to cover a diverse array of functionally
relevant biological responses. The resulting data set reveals that
gene-expression patterns are largely conserved, but significant changes may exist
in regulatory networks such as carbohydrate utilization and meiosis. In addition 
to regulatory changes, our approach identified gene functions that have diverged.
The functions of genes in core pathways are highly conserved, but we observed
many changes in which genes are involved in osmotic stress, peroxisome
biogenesis, and autophagy. A surprising number of genes specific to S. bayanus
respond to oxidative stress, suggesting the organism may have evolved under
different selection pressures than S. cerevisiae. This work expands the scope of 
genome-scale evolutionary studies from sequence-based analysis to rapid
experimental characterization and could be adopted for functional mapping in any 
lineage of interest. Furthermore, our detailed characterization of S. bayanus
provides a valuable resource for comparative functional genomics studies in
yeast.

Positive selection distorts the structure of genealogies and hence alters
patterns of genetic variation within a population. Most analyses of these
distortions focus on the signatures of hitchhiking due to hard or soft selective 
sweeps at a single genetic locus. However, in linked regions of rapidly adapting 
genomes, multiple beneficial mutations at different loci can segregate
simultaneously within the population, an effect known as clonal interference.
This leads to a subtle interplay between hitchhiking and interference effects,
which leads to a unique signature of rapid adaptation on genetic variation both
at the selected sites and at linked neutral loci. Here, we introduce an effective
coalescent theory (a "fitness-class coalescent") that describes how positive
selection at many perfectly linked sites alters the structure of genealogies. We 
use this theory to calculate several simple statistics describing genetic
variation within a rapidly adapting population and to implement efficient
backward-time coalescent simulations, which can be used to predict how clonal
interference alters the expected patterns of molecular evolution.

BACKGROUND: Interspecific hybridization occurs in every eukaryotic kingdom. While
hybrid progeny are frequently at a selective disadvantage, in some instances
their increased genome size and complexity may result in greater stress
resistance than their ancestors, which can be adaptively advantageous at the
edges of their ancestors' ranges. While this phenomenon has been repeatedly
documented in the field, the response of hybrid populations to long-term
selection has not often been explored in the lab. To fill this knowledge gap we
crossed the two most distantly related members of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto
group, S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum, and established a mixed population of
homoploid and aneuploid hybrids to study how different types of selection impact 
hybrid genome structure.
RESULTS: As temperature was raised incrementally from 31°C to 46.5°C over 500
generations of continuous culture, selection favored loss of the S. uvarum
genome, although the kinetics of genome loss differed among independent
replicates. Temperature-selected isolates exhibited greater inherent and induced 
thermal tolerance than parental species and founding hybrids, and also exhibited 
ethanol resistance. In contrast, as exogenous ethanol was increased from 0% to
14% over 500 generations of continuous culture, selection favored euploid S.
cerevisiae x S. uvarum hybrids. Ethanol-selected isolates were more ethanol
tolerant than S. uvarum and one of the founding hybrids, but did not exhibit
resistance to temperature stress. Relative to parental and founding hybrids,
temperature-selected strains showed heritable differences in cell wall structure 
in the forms of increased resistance to zymolyase digestion and Micafungin, which
targets cell wall biosynthesis.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show experimentally that the genomic fate
of newly-formed interspecific hybrids depends on the type of selection they
encounter during the course of evolution, underscoring the importance of the
ecological theatre in determining the outcome of the evolutionary play.

Hunger artists: yeast adapted to carbon limitation show trade-offs under carbon
sufficiency.

As organisms adaptively evolve to a new environment, selection results in the
improvement of certain traits, bringing about an increase in fitness. Trade-offs 
may result from this process if function in other traits is reduced in
alternative environments either by the adaptive mutations themselves or by the
accumulation of neutral mutations elsewhere in the genome. Though the cost of
adaptation has long been a fundamental premise in evolutionary biology, the
existence of and molecular basis for trade-offs in alternative environments are
not well-established. Here, we show that yeast evolved under aerobic glucose
limitation show surprisingly few trade-offs when cultured in other carbon-limited
environments, under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. However, while
adaptive clones consistently outperform their common ancestor under carbon
limiting conditions, in some cases they perform less well than their ancestor in 
aerobic, carbon-rich environments, indicating that trade-offs can appear when
resources are non-limiting. To more deeply understand how adaptation to one
condition affects performance in others, we determined steady-state transcript
abundance of adaptive clones grown under diverse conditions and performed
whole-genome sequencing to identify mutations that distinguish them from one
another and from their common ancestor. We identified mutations in genes involved
in glucose sensing, signaling, and transport, which, when considered in the
context of the expression data, help explain their adaptation to carbon poor
environments. However, different sets of mutations in each independently evolved 
clone indicate that multiple mutational paths lead to the adaptive phenotype. We 
conclude that yeasts that evolve high fitness under one resource-limiting
condition also become more fit under other resource-limiting conditions, but may 
pay a fitness cost when those same resources are abundant.

Microbial adaptation is conspicuous in essentially every environment but the
mechanisms of adaptive evolution are poorly understood. Studying evolution in the
laboratory under controlled conditions can be a tractable approach, particularly 
when new, discernible phenotypes evolve rapidly. This is especially the case in
the spatially structured environments of biofilms, which promote the occurrence
and stability of new, heritable phenotypes. Further, diversity in biofilms can
give rise to nascent social interactions among coexisting mutants and enable the 
study of the emerging field of sociomicrobiology. Here, we review findings from
laboratory evolution experiments with eitherPseudomonas fluorescensorBurkholderia
cenocepaciain spatially structured environments that promote biofilm formation.
In both systems, ecotypes with overlapping niches evolve and produce competitive 
or facilitative interactions that lead to novel community attributes,
demonstrating the parallelism of adaptive processes captured in the lab.

The ecological and evolutionary forces that promote and maintain diversity in
biofilms are not well understood. To quantify these forces, threePseudomonas
aeruginosapopulations were experimentally evolved from strain PA14 in a daily
cycle of attachment, assembly and dispersal for 600 generations. Each biofilm
population evolved diverse colony morphologies and mutator genotypes defective in
DNA mismatch repair. This diversity enhanced population fitness and biofilm
output, owing partly to rare, early-colonizing mutants that enhanced attachment
of others. Evolved mutants exhibited varied levels of the intracellular signal
cyclic-di-GMP, which associated with their timing of adherence. Manipulating
cyclic-di-GMP levels within individual mutants revealed a network of interactions
in the population that depended on varied attachment strategies related to this
signal. Diversification in biofilms may therefore arise and be reinforced by
initial colonists that enable community assembly.IMPORTANCE: How biofilm
diversity assembles, evolves and contributes to community function is largely
unknown. This presents a major challenge for understanding evolution during
chronic infections and during the growth of all surface-associated microbes. We
used experimental evolution to probe these dynamics and found that diversity,
partly related to altered cyclic-di-GMP levels, arose and persisted due to the
emergence of ecological interdependencies related to attachment patterns. Clonal 
isolates failed to capture population attributes, which points to the need to
account for diversity in infections. More broadly, this study offers an
experimental framework for linking phenotypic variation to distinct ecological
strategies in biofilms and for studying eco-evolutionary interactions.

Beneficial mutations fuel adaptation by altering phenotypes that enhance the fit 
of organisms to their environment. However, the phenotypic effects of mutations
often depend on ecological context, making the distribution of effects across
multiple environments essential to understanding the true nature of beneficial
mutations. Studies that address both the genetic basis and ecological
consequences of adaptive mutations remain rare. Here, we characterize the direct 
and pleiotropic fitness effects of a collection of 21 first-step beneficial
mutants derived from naïve and adapted genotypes used in a long-term experimental
evolution of Escherichia coli. Whole-genome sequencing was able to identify the
majority of beneficial mutations. In contrast to previous studies, we find
diverse fitness effects of mutations selected in a simple environment and few
cases of genetic parallelism. The pleiotropic effects of these mutations were
predominantly positive but some mutants were highly antagonistic in alternative
environments. Further, the fitness effects of mutations derived from the adapted 
genotypes were dramatically reduced in nearly all environments. These findings
suggest that many beneficial variants are accessible from a single point on the
fitness landscape, and the fixation of alternative beneficial mutations may have 
dramatic consequences for niche breadth reduction via metabolic erosion.

Aneuploidy and aging are correlated; however, a causal link between these two
phenomena has remained elusive. Here, we show that yeast disomic for a single
native yeast chromosome generally have a decreased replicative lifespan. In
addition, the extent of this lifespan deficit correlates with the size of the
extra chromosome. We identified a mutation in BUL1 that rescues both the lifespan
deficit and a protein trafficking defect in yeast disomic for chromosome 5. Bul1 
is an E4 ubiquitin ligase adaptor involved in a protein quality control pathway
that targets membrane proteins for endocytosis and destruction in the lysosomal
vacuole, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis. Concurrent suppression of the
aging and trafficking phenotypes suggests that disrupted membrane protein
homeostasis in aneuploid yeast may contribute to their accelerated aging. The
data reported here demonstrate that aneuploidy can impair protein homeostasis,
shorten lifespan, and may contribute to age-associated phenotypes.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, beneficial mutations selected during
sulfate limited growth are typically amplifications of the SUL1 gene which
encodes the high affinity sulfate transporter, resulting in fitness increases of 
>35%. Cis-regulatory mutations have not been observed at this locus; however, it 
is not clear whether this absence is due to a low mutation rate such that these
mutations do not arise, or they arise but have limited fitness effects relative
to those of amplification. To address this question directly, we assayed the
fitness effects of nearly all possible point mutations in a 493 base segment of
the gene's promoter through mutagenesis and selection. While most mutations were 
either neutral or detrimental during sulfate-limited growth, eight mutations
increased fitness more than 5% and as much as 9.4%. Combinations of these
beneficial mutations increased fitness only up to 11%. Thus, in the case of SUL1,
promoter mutations could not induce a fitness increase similar to that of gene
amplification. Using these data, we identified functionally-important regions of 
the SUL1 promoter and analyzed three sites that correspond to potential binding
sites for the transcription factors Met32 and Cbf1. Mutations that create new
Met32 or Cbf1 binding sites also increased fitness. Some mutations in the
untranslated region of the SUL1 transcript decreased fitness, likely due to the
formation of inhibitory upstream open-reading frames. Our methodology--saturation
mutagenesis, chemostat selection, and DNA sequencing to track variants-- should
be a broadly applicable approach.

BACKGROUND: Entomopathogenic associations between nematodes in the genera
Steinernema and Heterorhabdus with their cognate bacteria from the bacterial
genera Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus, respectively, are extensively studied for
their potential as biological control agents against invasive insect species.
These two highly coevolved associations were results of convergent evolution.
Given the natural abundance of bacteria, nematodes and insects, it is surprising 
that only these two associations with no intermediate forms are widely studied in
the entomopathogenic context. Discovering analogous systems involving novel
bacterial and nematode species would shed light on the evolutionary processes
involved in the transition from free living organisms to obligatory partners in
entomopathogenicity.
RESULTS: We report the complete genome sequence of a new member of the
enterobacterial genus Serratia that forms a putative entomopathogenic complex
with Caenorhabditis briggsae. Analysis of the 5.04 MB chromosomal genome predicts
4599 protein coding genes, seven sets of ribosomal RNA genes, 84 tRNA genes and a
64.8 KB plasmid encoding 74 genes. Comparative genomic analysis with three of the
previously sequenced Serratia species, S. marcescens DB11 and S. proteamaculans
568, and Serratia sp. AS12, revealed that these four representatives of the genus
share a core set of ~3100 genes and extensive structural conservation. The newly 
identified species shares a more recent common ancestor with S. marcescens with
99% sequence identity in rDNA sequence and orthology across 85.6% of predicted
genes. Of the 39 genes/operons implicated in the virulence, symbiosis,
recolonization, immune evasion and bioconversion, 21 (53.8%) were present in
Serratia while 33 (84.6%) and 35 (89%) were present in Xenorhabdus and
Photorhabdus EPN bacteria respectively.
CONCLUSION: The majority of unique sequences in Serratia sp. SCBI (South African 
Caenorhabditis briggsae Isolate) are found in ~29 genomic islands of 5 to 65
genes and are enriched in putative functions that are biologically relevant to an
entomopathogenic lifestyle, including non-ribosomal peptide synthetases,
bacteriocins, fimbrial biogenesis, ushering proteins, toxins, secondary
metabolite secretion and multiple drug resistance/efflux systems. By revealing
the early stages of adaptation to this lifestyle, the Serratia sp. SCBI genome
underscores the fact that in EPN formation the composite end result - killing,
bioconversion, cadaver protection and recolonization- can be achieved by
dissimilar mechanisms. This genome sequence will enable further study of the
evolution of entomopathogenic nematode-bacteria complexes.

Mutator alleles, which elevate an individual's mutation rate from 10 to
10,000-fold, have been found at high frequencies in many natural and experimental
populations. Mutators are continually produced from nonmutators, often due to
mutations in mismatch-repair genes. These mutators gradually accumulate
deleterious mutations, limiting their spread. However, they can occasionally
hitchhike to high frequencies with beneficial mutations. We study the interplay
between these effects. We first analyze the dynamics of the balance between the
production of mutator alleles and their elimination due to deleterious mutations.
We find that when deleterious mutation rates are high in mutators, there will
often be many "young," recently produced mutators in the population, and the fact
that deleterious mutations only gradually eliminate individuals from a population
is important. We then consider how this mutator-nonmutator balance can be
disrupted by beneficial mutations and analyze the circumstances in which fixation
of mutator alleles is likely. We find that dynamics is crucial: even in
situations where selection on average acts against mutators, so they cannot
stably invade, the mutators can still occasionally generate beneficial mutations 
and hence be important to the evolution of the population.

Experimental evolution of microbes is a powerful tool to study adaptation to
strong selection, the mechanism of evolution and the development of new traits.
The development of high-throughput sequencing methods has given researchers a new
ability to cheaply and easily identify mutations genome wide that are selected
during the course of experimental evolution. Here we provide a protocol for
conducting experimental evolution of yeast using chemostats, including fitness
measurement and whole genome sequencing of evolved clones or populations
collected during the experiment. Depending on the number of generations
appropriate for the experiment, the number of samples tested and the sequencing
platform, this protocol takes from 1 month to several months to be completed,
with the possibility of processing several strains or mutants at once.

DNA replication errors are a major driver of evolution--from single nucleotide
polymorphisms to large-scale copy number variations (CNVs). Here we test a
specific replication-based model to explain the generation of interstitial,
inverted triplications. While no genetic information is lost, the novel inversion
junctions and increased copy number of the included sequences create the
potential for adaptive phenotypes. The model--Origin-Dependent Inverted-Repeat
Amplification (ODIRA)-proposes that a replication error at pre-existing short,
interrupted, inverted repeats in genomic sequences generates an extrachromosomal,
inverted dimeric, autonomously replicating intermediate; subsequent genomic
integration of the dimer yields this class of CNV without loss of distal
chromosomal sequences. We used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches
to test the feasibility of the proposed replication error and its downstream
consequences on chromosome structure in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We
show that the proposed replication error-the ligation of leading and lagging
nascent strands to create "closed" forks-can occur in vitro at short, interrupted
inverted repeats. The removal of molecules with two closed forks results in a
hairpin-capped linear duplex that we show replicates in vivo to create an
inverted, dimeric plasmid that subsequently integrates into the genome by
homologous recombination, creating an inverted triplication. While other models
have been proposed to explain inverted triplications and their derivatives, our
model can also explain the generation of human, de novo, inverted amplicons that 
have a 2:1 mixture of sequences from both homologues of a single parent--a
feature readily explained by a plasmid intermediate that arises from one
homologue and integrates into the other homologue prior to meiosis. Our tests of 
key features of ODIRA lend support to this mechanism and suggest further avenues 
of enquiry to unravel the origins of interstitial, inverted CNVs pivotal in human
health and evolution.

Vibrio parahaemolyticus sequence type 36 (ST36) strains that are native to the
Pacific Ocean have recently caused multistate outbreaks of gastroenteritis linked
to shellfish harvested from the Atlantic Ocean. Whole-genome comparisons of 295
genomes of V. parahaemolyticus, including several traced to northeastern U.S.
sources, were used to identify diagnostic loci, one putatively encoding an
endonuclease (prp), and two others potentially conferring O-antigenic properties 
(cps and flp). The combination of all three loci was present in only one clade of
closely related strains of ST36, ST59, and one additional unknown sequence type. 
However, each locus was also identified outside this clade, with prp and flp
occurring in only two nonclade isolates and cps in four. Based on the
distribution of these loci in sequenced genomes, prp identified clade strains
with >99% accuracy, but the addition of one more locus increased accuracy to
100%. Oligonucleotide primers targeting prp and cps were combined in a multiplex 
PCR method that defines species using the tlh locus and determines the presence
of both the tdh and trh hemolysin-encoding genes, which are also present in ST36.
Application of the method in vitro to a collection of 94 clinical isolates
collected over a 4-year period in three northeastern U.S. states and 87
environmental isolates revealed that the prp and cps amplicons were detected only
in clinical isolates identified as belonging to the ST36 clade and in no
environmental isolates from the region. The assay should improve detection and
surveillance, thereby reducing infections.

We chronicle and dissect the history of the field of Experimental Microbial
Evolution, beginning with work by Monod. Early research was largely carried out
by microbiologists and biochemists, who used experimental evolutionary change as 
a tool to understand structure-function relationships. These studies attracted
the interest of evolutionary biologists who recognized the power of the approach 
to address issues such as the tempo of adaptive change, the costs and benefits of
sex, parallelism, and the role which contingency plays in the evolutionary
process. In the 1980s and 1990s, an ever-expanding body of microbial,
physiological and biochemical data, together with new technologies for
manipulating microbial genomes, allowed such questions to be addressed in
ever-increasing detail. Since then, technological advances leading to low-cost,
high-throughput DNA sequencing have made it possible for these and other
fundamental questions in evolutionary biology to be addressed at the molecular
level.

Metabolic gene clusters--functionally related and physically clustered genes--are
a common feature of some eukaryotic genomes. Two hypotheses have been advanced to
explain the origin and maintenance of metabolic gene clusters: coordinated gene
expression and genetic linkage. Here we test the hypothesis that selection for
coordinated gene expression underlies the clustering of GAL genes in the yeast
genome. We find that, although clustering coordinates the expression of GAL1 and 
GAL10, disrupting the GAL cluster does not impair fitness, suggesting that other 
mechanisms, such as genetic linkage, drive the origin and maintenance metabolic
gene clusters.

BACKGROUND: Analysis of plasma clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine (norclozapine) 
for therapeutic drug monitoring purposes is well established. To minimize
analysis times and facilitate rapid reporting of results, we have fully automated
sample preparation using novel AC Extraction Plates and a Tecan Freedom EVO 100
liquid handling platform, and minimized extract analysis times using
flow-injection tandem mass spectrometry (FIA-MS/MS).
METHODS: Analytes and deuterium-labeled internal standards were extracted from
plasma (100 μL) at pH 10.6 and extracts analyzed directly using tandem mass
spectrometry [20 μL injection, 0.7 mL/min methanol carrier flow, analysis time
(injection-to-injection) approximately 60 seconds].
RESULTS: Validation data showed excellent intraplate and interplate accuracy
(95%-104% nominal concentrations). Interbatch precision (% RSD) at the limit of
quantitation (0.01 mg/L) was 3.5% and 5.5% for clozapine and norclozapine,
respectively. Matrix effects were observed for both clozapine and norclozapine,
but were compensated for by the internal standards. Overall process efficiency
was 56%-70% and 66%-77% for clozapine and norclozapine, respectively. Mean
relative process efficiency was 98% and 99% for clozapine and norclozapine,
respectively. Comparison of results from patient samples (n = 81) analyzed using 
(1) manual liquid-liquid extraction with liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and (2) automated extraction with FIA-MS/MS gave y =
1.01x - 0.002, R = 0.9943 and y = 1.01x + 0.009, R = 0.9957 for clozapine and
norclozapine, respectively. Bland-Altman plots revealed a [mean (95% limits of
agreement) bias of 0.0074 (-0.04 to 0.06) mg/L and of 0.015 (-0.02 to 0.05) mg/L 
for clozapine and norclozapine, respectively].
CONCLUSIONS: FIA-MS/MS used with automated extraction offers a rapid, simple,
cost-effective alternative to manual liquid-liquid extraction and conventional LC
analysis for clozapine therapeutic drug monitoring.

Colonization of vacant environments may catalyze adaptive diversification and be 
followed by competition within the nascent community. How these interactions
ultimately stabilize and affect productivity are central problems in evolutionary
ecology. Diversity can emerge by character displacement, in which selection
favors phenotypes that exploit an alternative resource and reduce competition, or
by facilitation, in which organisms change the environment and enable different
genotypes or species to become established. We previously developed a model of
long-term experimental evolution in which bacteria attach to a plastic bead, form
a biofilm, and disperse to a new bead. Here, we focus on the evolution of
coexisting mutants within a population of Burkholderia cenocepacia and how their 
interactions affected productivity. Adaptive mutants initially competed for
space, but later competition declined, consistent with character displacement and
the predicted effects of the evolved mutations. The community reached a stable
equilibrium as each ecotype evolved to inhabit distinct, complementary regions of
the biofilm. Interactions among ecotypes ultimately became facilitative and
enhanced mixed productivity. Observing the succession of genotypes within niches 
illuminated changing selective forces within the community, including a
fundamental role for genotypes producing small colony variants that underpin
chronic infections caused by B. cenocepacia.

BACKGROUND: Wine produced at low temperature is often considered to improve
sensory qualities. However, there are certain drawbacks to low temperature
fermentations: e.g. low growth rate, long lag phase, and sluggish or stuck
fermentations. Selection and development of new Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains 
well adapted at low temperature is interesting for future biotechnological
applications. This study aimed to select and develop wine yeast strains that well
adapt to ferment at low temperature through evolutionary engineering, and to
decipher the process underlying the obtained phenotypes.
RESULTS: We used a pool of 27 commercial yeast strains and set up batch serial
dilution experiments to mimic wine fermentation conditions at 12 °C. Evolutionary
engineering was accomplished by using the natural yeast mutation rate and
mutagenesis procedures. One strain (P5) outcompeted the others under both
experimental conditions and was able to impose after 200 generations. The evolved
strains showed improved growth and low-temperature fermentation performance
compared to the ancestral strain. This improvement was acquired only under
inositol limitation. The transcriptomic comparison between the evolved and
parental strains showed the greatest up-regulation in four mannoprotein coding
genes, which belong to the DAN/TIR family (DAN1, TIR1, TIR4 and TIR3). Genome
sequencing of the evolved strain revealed the presence of a SNP in the GAA1 gene 
and the construction of a site-directed mutant (GAA1 (Thr108)) in a derivative
haploid of the ancestral strain resulted in improved fermentation performance.
GAA1 encodes a GPI transamidase complex subunit that adds GPI, which is required 
for inositol synthesis, to newly synthesized proteins, including mannoproteins.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study we demonstrate the importance of inositol and
mannoproteins in yeast adaptation at low temperature and the central role of the 
GAA1 gene by linking both metabolisms.

Studying Candida biology requires access to genomic sequence data in conjunction 
with experimental information that provides functional context to genes and
proteins. The Candida Genome Database (CGD) integrates functional information
about Candida genes and their products with a set of analysis tools that
facilitate searching for sets of genes and exploring their biological roles. This
chapter describes how the various types of information available at CGD can be
searched, retrieved, and analyzed. Starting with the guided tour of the CGD Home 
page and Locus Summary page, this unit shows how to navigate the various
assemblies of the C. albicans genome, how to use Gene Ontology tools to make
sense of large-scale data, and how to access the microarray data archived at CGD.

Transcription factors canonically bind nucleosome-free DNA, making the
positioning of nucleosomes within regulatory regions crucial to the regulation of
gene expression. Using the assay of transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq), 
we observe a highly structured pattern of DNA fragment lengths and positions
around nucleosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and use this distinctive
two-dimensional nucleosomal "fingerprint" as the basis for a new
nucleosome-positioning algorithm called NucleoATAC. We show that NucleoATAC can
identify the rotational and translational positions of nucleosomes with up to
base-pair resolution and provide quantitative measures of nucleosome occupancy in
S. cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and human cells. We demonstrate the
application of NucleoATAC to a number of outstanding problems in chromatin
biology, including analysis of sequence features underlying nucleosome
positioning, promoter chromatin architecture across species, identification of
transient changes in nucleosome occupancy and positioning during a dynamic
cellular response, and integrated analysis of nucleosome occupancy and
transcription factor binding.

Gastric infections caused by the environmentally transmitted pathogen, Vibrio
parahaemolyticus, have increased over the last two decades, including in many
parts of the United States (US). However, until recently, infections linked to
shellfish from the cool northeastern US waters were rare. Cases have risen in the
Northeast, consistent with changes in local V. parahaemolyticus populations
toward greater abundance or a shift in constituent pathogens. We examined 94
clinical isolates from a period of increasing disease in the region and compared 
them to 200 environmental counterparts to identify resident and non-indigenous
lineages and to gain insight into the emergence of pathogenic types. Genotyping
and multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) of clinical isolates collected from 2010
to 2013 in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine revealed their polyphyletic
nature. Although 80% of the clinical isolates harbored the trh hemolysin either
alone or with tdh, and were urease positive, 14% harbored neither hemolysin
exposing a limitation for these traits in pathogen detection. Resident sequence
type (ST) 631 strains caused seven infections, and show a relatively recent
history of recombination with other clinical and environmental lineages present
in the region. ST34 and ST674 strains were each linked to a single infection and 
these strain types were also identified from the environment as isolates
harboring hemolysin genes. Forty-two ST36 isolates were identified from the
clinical collection, consistent with reports that this strain type caused a rise 
in regional infections starting in 2012. Whole-genome phylogenies that included
three ST36 outbreak isolates traced to at least two local sources demonstrated
that the US Atlantic coastal population of this strain type was indeed derived
from the Pacific population. This study lays the foundation for understanding
dynamics within natural populations associated with emergence and invasion of
pathogenic strain types in the region.

Experimental evolution paired with modern sequencing can be a powerful approach
to identify the mechanisms by which bacteria adapt to discrete environmental
conditions found in nature or during infections. We used this approach to
identify mechanisms enabling biofilm specialists of the opportunistic respiratory
pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia to regain planktonic fitness. Seven mutants
producing wrinkly (W) small-colony variants by mutations in the wrinkly-spreader 
operon (wsp) cluster, but with varying duration of biofilm adaptation, served as 
ancestors of this experiment. Following planktonic growth, each W ancestor
produced smooth (S) mutants with distinct fitness effects across planktonic,
biofilm, and dispersal-phase environments. The causes of the S phenotype traced
to mutations in three gene clusters: wsp, Bcen2424_1436, an uncharacterized
two-component transcriptional regulator which appears to be critical for wsp
signaling, and a cohort of genes involved in polysaccharide synthesis. The
genetic pathway from W to S also associated with evolutionary history in the
biofilm environment. W mutants isolated from long-term biofilm selection usually 
produced S types via secondary wsp mutations, whereas S types evolved from less
adapted W ancestors by a wider scope of mutations. These different genetic
pathways to suppress the W phenotype suggest that prolonged biofilm adaptation
limits routes to subsequent planktonic adaptation, despite common initial
mechanisms of biofilm adaptation. More generally, experimental evolution can be
used as a nuanced screen for gain-of-function mutations in multiple conditions
that illustrate tensions that bacteria may face in changing environments or
hosts.

ATP-binding cassette transporters Pdr5 and Yor1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae
control the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids across the plasma membrane
as well as serving as ATP-dependent drug efflux pumps. Mutant strains lacking
these transporter proteins were found to exhibit very different resistance
phenotypes to two inhibitors of sphingolipid biosynthesis that act either late
(aureobasidin A [AbA]) or early (myriocin [Myr]) in the pathway leading to
production of these important plasma membrane lipids. These pdr5Δ yor1 strains
were highly AbA resistant but extremely sensitive to Myr. We provide evidence
that these phenotypic changes are likely due to modulation of the plasma membrane
flippase complexes, Dnf1/Lem3 and Dnf2/Lem3. Flippases act to move phospholipids 
from the outer to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Genetic analyses
indicate that lem3Δ mutant strains are highly AbA sensitive and Myr resistant.
These phenotypes are fully epistatic to those seen in pdr5Δ yor1 strains. Direct 
analysis of AbA-induced signaling demonstrated that loss of Pdr5 and Yor1
inhibited the AbA-triggered phosphorylation of the AGC kinase Ypk1 and its
substrate Orm1. Microarray experiments found that a pdr5Δ yor1 strain induced a
Pdr1-dependent induction of the entire Pdr regulon. Our data support the view
that Pdr5/Yor1 negatively regulate flippase function and activity of the nuclear 
Pdr1 transcription factor. Together, these data argue that the interaction of the
ABC transporters Pdr5 and Yor1 with the Lem3-dependent flippases regulates
permeability of AbA via control of plasma membrane protein function as seen for
the high-affinity tryptophan permease Tat2.

Accurate sequence and assembly of genomes is a critical first step for studies of
genetic variation. We generated a high-quality assembly of the gorilla genome
using single-molecule, real-time sequence technology and a string graph de novo
assembly algorithm. The new assembly improves contiguity by two to three orders
of magnitude with respect to previously released assemblies, recovering 87% of
missing reference exons and incomplete gene models. Although regions of large,
high-identity segmental duplications remain largely unresolved, this
comprehensive assembly provides new biological insight into genetic diversity,
structural variation, gene loss, and representation of repeat structures within
the gorilla genome. The approach provides a path forward for the routine assembly
of mammalian genomes at a level approaching that of the current quality of the
human genome.

Conjugative (horizontally transmissible) plasmids are autonomous replicators,
whose "self-interests" do not necessarily overlap with those of their hosts. This
situation causes plasmids and bacteria to sometimes experience differing
selection pressures. Escherichia coli plasmid pB15 contains genes for resistance 
to several antibiotics, including tetracycline. When plasmid-bearing cells were
experimentally evolved in the laboratory, changes in resistance level in the
unselected tetracycline marker coincided with changes in plasmid rates of
vertical versus horizontal transmission. Here, we used minimum inhibitory assays 
that measure resistance levels as quantitative traits to determine phenotypic
correlations among plasmid characters and to estimate divergence among plasmid
lineages. Results suggested that plasmid-level evolution led to formation of two 
phenotypically dissimilar groups: virulent (highly infectious) and avirulent
(weakly infectious) plasmids. In contrast, measures of carbon-source utilization,
and fitness assays relative to a common competitor revealed that bacterial hosts 
generally converged in phenotypic performance, despite divergence among their
associated plasmids. Preliminary sequence analyses suggested that divergence in
plasmid conjugation was due to altered configurations of a shufflon region (a
site-specific recombination system), where genetic rearrangements affect
conjugative ability. Furthermore, we proposed that correlated resistance and
transmission in pB15 derivatives were caused by a tetracycline-resistance
transposon inserted into a transfer operon, allowing transcription from its
promoter to simultaneously affect both plasmid resistance and transmission.

A common phenotype within bacterial biofilms is the small, "wrinkly" colony,
which may associate with worse prognoses from biofilm-associated infections. The 
mechanisms that produce these variants in Burkholderia are undefined. Here we
report the mutational and ecological causes of wrinkly (W) colonies that evolved 
during experimental biofilm evolution of Burkholderia cenocepacia. Mutations
clustered in a homologous pathway to the Pseudomonas wsp operon but with a
distinct terminal signaling mechanism, and their parallel evolution suggested
that they inhabited an equivalent biofilm niche. We tested this hypothesis of
niche complementarity by measuring effects of substituting different W variants
in the same evolved biofilm community. Despite phenotypic differences among W
mutants growing alone, fitness of reconstituted mixed biofilms did not differ
significantly. In conclusion, the evolution of small-colony variants in
Burkholderia biofilms appears to be driven by an ecological opportunity that
generates strong selection for constitutive wsp mutants to inhabit a common
niche.

Aneuploidy is a hallmark of tumor cells, and yet the precise relationship between
aneuploidy and a cell's proliferative ability, or cellular fitness, has remained 
elusive. In this study, we have combined a detailed analysis of aneuploid clones 
isolated from laboratory-evolved populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with a
systematic, genome-wide screen for the fitness effects of telomeric
amplifications to address the relationship between aneuploidy and cellular
fitness. We found that aneuploid clones rise to high population frequencies in
nutrient-limited evolution experiments and show increased fitness relative to
wild type. Direct competition experiments confirmed that three out of four
aneuploid events isolated from evolved populations were themselves sufficient to 
improve fitness. To expand the scope beyond this small number of exemplars, we
created a genome-wide collection of >1,800 diploid yeast strains, each containing
a different telomeric amplicon (Tamp), ranging in size from 0.4 to 1,000 kb.
Using pooled competition experiments in nutrient-limited chemostats followed by
high-throughput sequencing of strain-identifying barcodes, we determined the
fitness effects of these >1,800 Tamps under three different conditions. Our data 
revealed that the fitness landscape explored by telomeric amplifications is much 
broader than that explored by single-gene amplifications. As also observed in the
evolved clones, we found the fitness effects of most Tamps to be condition
specific, with a minority showing common effects in all three conditions. By
integrating our data with previous work that examined the fitness effects of
single-gene amplifications genome-wide, we found that a small number of genes
within each Tamp are centrally responsible for each Tamp's fitness effects. Our
genome-wide Tamp screen confirmed that telomeric amplifications identified in
laboratory-evolved populations generally increased fitness. Our results show that
Tamps are mutations that produce large, typically condition-dependent changes in 
fitness that are important drivers of increased fitness in asexually evolving
populations.

DeRisi and colleagues present a creative application for Cas9 in vitro, using it 
to deplete unwanted sequence from DNA libraries. It seems plausible that the in
vitro use of CRISPR/Cas9 has unrealized potential to revolutionize the practice
of molecular biology well beyond genome editing.

Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) arise from pathogenic mutations in
over one hundred genes leading to impaired protein or lipid glycosylation. ALG1
encodes a β1,4 mannosyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of the first of
nine mannose moieties to form a dolichol-lipid linked oligosaccharide
intermediate (DLO) required for proper N-linked glycosylation. ALG1 mutations
cause a rare autosomal recessive disorder termed ALG1-CDG. To date thirteen
mutations in eighteen patients from fourteen families have been described with
varying degrees of clinical severity. We identified and characterized thirty-nine
previously unreported cases of ALG1-CDG from thirty-two families and add
twenty-six new mutations. Pathogenicity of each mutation was confirmed based on
its inability to rescue impaired growth or hypoglycosylation of a standard
biomarker in an alg1-deficient yeast strain. Using this approach we could not
establish a rank order comparison of biomarker glycosylation and patient
phenotype, but we identified mutations with a lethal outcome in the first two
years of life. The recently identified protein-linked xeno-tetrasaccharide
biomarker, NeuAc-Gal-GlcNAc2 , was seen in all twenty-seven patients tested. Our 
study triples the number of known patients and expands the molecular and clinical
correlates of this disorder. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

RATIONALE: Mutations in several genes have been identified that are responsible
for 25% of families with familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.
However, the causative gene remains unknown in 75% of families.
OBJECTIVES: To identify the causative mutation in families with autosomal
dominant inheritance of thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Exome sequencing was used to identify the mutation
responsible for a large family with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. A 
heterozygous rare variant, c.839G>T (p.Ser280Arg), was identified in LOX,
encoding a lysyl oxidase, that segregated with disease in the family. Sanger and 
exome sequencing was used to investigate mutations in LOX in an additional 410
probands from unrelated families. Additional LOX rare variants that segregated
with disease in families were identified, including c.125G>A (p.Trp42*), c.604G>T
(p.Gly202*), c.743C>T (p.Thr248Ile), c.800A>C (p.Gln267Pro), and c.1044T>A
(p.Ser348Arg). The altered amino acids cause haploinsufficiency for LOX or are
located at a highly conserved LOX catalytic domain, which is relatively invariant
in the population. Expression of the LOX variants p.Ser280Arg and p.Ser348Arg
resulted in significantly lower lysyl oxidase activity when compared with the
wild-type protein. Individuals with LOX variants had fusiform enlargement of the 
root and ascending thoracic aorta, leading to ascending aortic dissections.
CONCLUSIONS: These data, along with previous studies showing that the deficiency 
of LOX in mice or inhibition of lysyl oxidases in turkeys and rats causes aortic 
dissections, support the conclusion that rare genetic variants in LOX predispose 
to thoracic aortic disease.

BACKGROUND: The term nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC) describes a 
group of rare autosomal-recessive cystic kidney diseases, characterised by broad 
genetic and clinical heterogeneity. NPHP-RC is frequently associated with
extrarenal manifestations and accounts for the majority of genetically caused
chronic kidney disease (CKD) during childhood and adolescence. Generation of a
molecular diagnosis has been impaired by this broad genetic heterogeneity.
However, recently developed high-throughput exon sequencing techniques represent 
powerful and efficient tools to screen large cohorts for dozens of causative
genes.
METHODS: Therefore, we performed massively multiplexed targeted sequencing using 
the modified molecular inversion probe strategy (MIPs) in an international cohort
of 384 patients diagnosed with NPHP-RC.
RESULTS: As a result, we established the molecular diagnoses in 81/384 unrelated 
individuals (21.1%). We detected 127 likely disease-causing mutations in 18 of 34
evaluated NPHP-RC genes, 22 of which were novel. We further compared a subgroup
of current findings to the results of a previous study in which we used an
array-based microfluidic PCR technology in the same cohort. While 78 likely
disease-causing mutations were previously detected by the array-based
microfluidic PCR, the MIPs approach identified 94 likely pathogenic mutations.
Compared with the previous approach, MIPs redetected 66 out of 78 variants and 28
previously unidentified variants, for a total of 94 variants.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we demonstrate that the modified MIPs technology is a
useful approach to screen large cohorts for a multitude of established NPHP genes
in order to identify the underlying molecular cause. Combined application of two 
independent library preparation and sequencing techniques, however, may still be 
indicated for Mendelian diseases with extensive genetic heterogeneity in order to
further increase diagnostic sensitivity.

While the cost of DNA sequencing has dropped by five orders of magnitude in the
past decade, DNA synthesis remains expensive for many applications. Although DNA 
microarrays have decreased the cost of oligonucleotide synthesis, the use of
array-synthesized oligos in practice is limited by short synthesis lengths, high 
synthesis error rates, low yield and the challenges of assembling long constructs
from complex pools. Toward addressing these issues, we developed a protocol for
multiplex pairwise assembly of oligos from array-synthesized oligonucleotide
pools. To evaluate the method, we attempted to assemble up to 2271 targets
ranging in length from 192-252 bases using pairs of array-synthesized oligos.
Within sets of complexity ranging from 131-250 targets, we observed error-free
assemblies for 90.5% of all targets. When all 2271 targets were assembled in one 
reaction, we observed error-free constructs for 70.6%. While the assembly method 
intrinsically increased accuracy to a small degree, we further increased accuracy
by using a high throughput 'Dial-Out PCR' protocol, which combines Illumina
sequencing with an in-house set of unique PCR tags to selectively amplify perfect
assemblies from complex synthetic pools. This approach has broad applicability to
DNA assembly and high-throughput functional screens.

BACKGROUND: Nonphotosensitive trichothiodystrophy (TTDN) is a rare autosomal
recessive disorder of neuroectodermal origin. The condition is marked by hair
abnormalities, intellectual impairment, nail dystrophies and susceptibility to
infections but with no UV sensitivity.
METHODS: We identified three consanguineous Pakistani families with varied TTDN
features and used homozygosity mapping, linkage analysis, and Sanger and exome
sequencing in order to identify pathogenic variants. Haplotype analysis was
performed and haplotype age estimated. A splicing assay was used to validate the 
effect of the MPLKIP splice variant on expression.
RESULTS: Affected individuals from all families exhibit several TTDN features
along with a heart-specific feature, i.e. mitral regurgitation. Exome sequencing 
in the probands from families ED168 and ED241 identified a homozygous splice
mutation c.339 + 1G > A within MPLKIP. The same splice variant co-segregates with
TTDN in a third family ED210. The MPLKIP splice variant was not found in public
databases, e.g. the Exome Aggregation Consortium, and in unrelated Pakistani
controls. Functional analysis of the splice variant confirmed intron retention,
which leads to protein truncation and loss of a phosphorylation site. Haplotype
analysis identified a 585.1-kb haplotype which includes the MPLKIP variant,
supporting the existence of a founder haplotype that is estimated to be
25,900 years old.
CONCLUSION: This study extends the allelic and phenotypic spectra of
MPLKIP-related TTDN, to include a splice variant that causes cardiomyopathy as
part of the TTDN phenotype.

The manner by which eukaryotic genomes are packaged into nuclei while maintaining
crucial nuclear functions remains one of the fundamental mysteries in biology.
Over the last ten years, we have witnessed rapid advances in both microscopic and
nucleic acid-based approaches to map genome architecture, and the application of 
these approaches to the dissection of higher-order chromosomal structures has
yielded much new information. It is becoming increasingly clear, for example,
that interphase chromosomes form stable, multilevel hierarchical structures.
Among them, self-associating domains like so-called topologically associating
domains (TADs) appear to be building blocks for large-scale genomic organization.
This review describes features of these broadly-defined hierarchical structures, 
insights into the mechanisms underlying their formation, our current
understanding of how interactions in the nuclear space are linked to gene
regulation, and important future directions for the field.

Many populations live in environments subject to frequent biotic and abiotic
changes. Nonetheless, it is interesting to ask whether an evolving population's
mean fitness can increase indefinitely, and potentially without any limit, even
in a constant environment. A recent study showed that fitness trajectories of
Escherichia coli populations over 50 000 generations were better described by a
power-law model than by a hyperbolic model. According to the power-law model, the
rate of fitness gain declines over time but fitness has no upper limit, whereas
the hyperbolic model implies a hard limit. Here, we examine whether the
previously estimated power-law model predicts the fitness trajectory for an
additional 10 000 generations. To that end, we conducted more than 1100 new
competitive fitness assays. Consistent with the previous study, the power-law
model fits the new data better than the hyperbolic model. We also analysed the
variability in fitness among populations, finding subtle, but significant,
heterogeneity in mean fitness. Some, but not all, of this variation reflects
differences in mutation rate that evolved over time. Taken together, our results 
imply that both adaptation and divergence can continue indefinitely--or at least 
for a long time--even in a constant environment.

Ultraviolet and high-intensity visible radiation generate reactive intermediates 
that damage phototrophic microorganisms. In Yellowstone National Park, the
thermoacidophilic alga Cyanidioschyzon exhibits an annual seasonal biomass
fluctuation referred to as 'mat decline', where algal viability decreases as
ultraviolet and visible irradiances increase during summer. We examined the role 
irradiance might play in mat decline using irradiance filters that uncouple
ultraviolet and visible effects along with custom microarrays to study gene
expression in situ. Of the 6507 genes, 88% showed no response to ultraviolet or
visible, implying that at the biomolecular level, these algae inhabit a
chemostat-like environment and is consistent with the near constant aqueous
chemistry measured. The remaining genes exhibited expression changes linked to
ultraviolet exposure, to increased visible radiation, or to the apparent combined
effects of ultraviolet and visible. Expression of DNA repetitive elements was
synchronized, being repressed by visible but also influenced by ultraviolet. At
highest irradiance levels, these algae reduced transcription of genes encoding
functions involved with DNA replication, photosynthesis and cell cycle
progression but exhibited an uptick in activities related to repairing DNA
damage. This corroborates known physiological responses to ultraviolet and
visible radiation, and leads us to provisionally conclude that mat decline is
linked to photoinhibition.

Tumor heterogeneity may reduce the efficacy of molecularly guided systemic
therapy for cancers that have metastasized. To determine whether the genomic
alterations in a single metastasis provide a reasonable assessment of the major
oncogenic drivers of other dispersed metastases in an individual, we analyzed
multiple tumors from men with disseminated prostate cancer through whole-exome
sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and RNA transcript
profiling, and we compared the genomic diversity within and between individuals. 
In contrast to the substantial heterogeneity between men, there was limited
diversity among metastases within an individual. The number of somatic mutations,
the burden of genomic copy number alterations and aberrations in known oncogenic 
drivers were all highly concordant, as were metrics of androgen receptor (AR)
activity and cell cycle activity. AR activity was inversely associated with cell 
proliferation, whereas the expression of Fanconi anemia (FA)-complex genes was
correlated with elevated cell cycle progression, expression of the E2F
transcription factor 1 (E2F1) and loss of retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). Men with
somatic aberrations in FA-complex genes or in ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM)
exhibited significantly longer treatment-response durations to carboplatin than
did men without defects in genes encoding DNA-repair proteins. Collectively,
these data indicate that although exceptions exist, evaluating a single
metastasis provides a reasonable assessment of the major oncogenic driver
alterations that are present in disseminated tumors within an individual, and
thus may be useful for selecting treatments on the basis of predicted molecular
vulnerabilities.

BACKGROUND: Ichthyoses are clinically characterized by scaling or hyperkeratosis 
of the skin or both. It can be an isolated condition limited to the skin or
appear secondarily with involvement of other cutaneous or systemic abnormalities.
METHODS: The present study investigated clinical and molecular characterization
of three consanguineous families (A, B, C) segregating two different forms of
autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI). Linkage in three consanguineous
families (A, B, C) segregating two different forms of ARCI was searched by typing
microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism marker analysis. Sequencing of 
the two genes TGM1 and ALOXE3 was performed by the dideoxy chain termination
method.
RESULTS: Genome-wide linkage analysis established linkage in family A to TGM1
gene on chromosome 14q11 and in families B and C to ALOXE3 gene on chromosome
17p13. Subsequently, sequencing of these genes using samples from affected family
members led to the identification of three novel mutations: a missense variant
p.Trp455Arg in TGM1 (family A); a nonsense variant p.Arg140* in ALOXE3 (family
B); and a complex rearrangement in ALOXE3 (family C).
CONCLUSION: The present study further extends the spectrum of mutations in the
two genes involved in causing ARCI. Characterizing the clinical spectrum
resulting from mutations in the TGM1 and ALOXE3 genes will improve diagnosis and 
may direct clinical care of the family members.

Genome rearrangements, especially amplifications and deletions, have regularly
been observed as responses to sustained application of the same strong selective 
pressure in microbial populations growing in continuous culture. We studied eight
strains of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) isolated after 100-500
generations of growth in glucose-limited chemostats. Changes in DNA copy number
were assessed at single-gene resolution by using DNA microarray-based comparative
genomic hybridization. Six of these evolved strains were aneuploid as the result 
of gross chromosomal rearrangements. Most of the aneuploid regions were the
result of translocations, including three instances of a shared breakpoint on
chromosome 14 immediately adjacent to CIT1, which encodes the citrate synthase
that performs a key regulated step in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Three strains
had amplifications in a region of chromosome 4 that includes the high-affinity
hexose transporters; one of these also had the aforementioned chromosome 14
break. Three strains had extensive overlapping deletions of the right arm of
chromosome 15. Further analysis showed that each of these genome rearrangements
was bounded by transposon-related sequences at the breakpoints. The observation
of repeated, independent, but nevertheless very similar, chromosomal
rearrangements in response to persistent selection of growing cells parallels the
genome rearrangements that characteristically accompany tumor progression.

Studies of replicative and chronological lifespan in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
have advanced understanding of longevity in all eukaryotes. Chronological
lifespan in this species is defined as the age-dependent viability of nondividing
cells. To date this parameter has only been estimated under calorie restriction, 
mimicked by starvation. Because postmitotic cells in higher eukaryotes often do
not starve, we developed a model yeast system to study cells as they age in the
absence of calorie restriction. Yeast cells were encapsulated in a matrix
consisting of calcium alginate to form ∼3 mm beads that were packed into
bioreactors and fed ad libitum. Under these conditions cells ceased to divide,
became heat shock and zymolyase resistant, yet retained high fermentative
capacity. Over the course of 17 d, immobilized yeast cells maintained >95%
viability, whereas the viability of starving, freely suspended (planktonic) cells
decreased to <10%. Immobilized cells exhibited a stable pattern of gene
expression that differed markedly from growing or starving planktonic cells,
highly expressing genes in glycolysis, cell wall remodeling, and stress
resistance, but decreasing transcription of genes in the tricarboxylic acid
cycle, and genes that regulate the cell cycle, including master cyclins CDC28 and
CLN1. Stress resistance transcription factor MSN4 and its upstream effector RIM15
are conspicuously up-regulated in the immobilized state, and an immobilized rim15
knockout strain fails to exhibit the long-lived, growth-arrested phenotype,
suggesting that altered regulation of the Rim15-mediated nutrient-sensing pathway
plays an important role in extending yeast chronological lifespan under
calorie-unrestricted conditions.

Synonymous genetic differences vary by more than 20-fold among genes in natural
isolates of Escherichia coli. One hypothesis to explain this heterogeneity is
that genes with high levels of synonymous variation mutate at higher rates than
genes with low synonymous variation. If so, then one would expect to observe
similar mutational patterns in evolution experiments. In fact, however, the
pattern of synonymous substitutions in a long-term evolution experiment with E.
coli does not support this hypothesis. In particular, the extent of synonymous
variation across genes in that experiment does not reflect the variation observed
in natural isolates of E. coli. Instead, gene length alone predicts with high
accuracy the prevalence of synonymous changes in the experimental populations. We
hypothesize that patterns of synonymous variation in natural E. coli populations 
are instead caused by differences across genomic regions in their effective
population size that, in turn, reflect different histories of recombination,
horizontal gene transfer, selection, and population structure.
